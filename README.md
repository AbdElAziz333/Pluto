Pluto is a networking stack optimization mod and unofficial fork of the Fabric mod [Krypton](https://github.com/astei/krypton) for Minecraft, this mod aims to optimize the network stack of the game in order to provide better network performance. It works on both the **client and server**, It derives from work
